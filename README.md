## Front End Logic
This application receives Http Get requests from a back end server which contain Dungeons and Dragon information. The Data originates from   http://www.dnd5eapi.co/ though it has been altered slightly for the applications needs.

Users can register and/Or login into the application. From there the Users can create a team of monsters and fight enemy monsters.

The fight.compononent.ts contains the majority of the logic for the application. It uses methods to replicate simplified combat rules for 5th edition Dnd.
